ideas

modules
- construction module (upgrade ship, create stations which perform module functions better and cheaper)
- weapons modules
- communication module (various ranges of tx/rx, encryption of messages)
- some sort of energy / fuel mechanic for all processes, solar panels if stranded
- bookmarking objects (e.g. stations, estimates position & velocity outside navigation)
- hacking modules to disable other modules
- some sort of armor / shield module
- tractorbeam has range of effectiveness

world
- tiers of minerals, modules
- collisions
- figure how position floats overflow and how to improve it
- figure out spawning
- figure out some sort of dynamic zone system
- figure out other bodies (planets, suns, n-body simulation?)
- some sort of faction system so multiple accounts pool their scores together

nice to haves
- pretty dashboard
- more cli parsing stuff
- website with leaderboards, documentation, account stuff for main server
- open server api with documentation so people can develop their own clients
- server ability to quit and import/export all current data
- have something like lightshope donation page
- give tractorbeam client bring option ability to choose desired distance
- make constants file some way of being global and read on run so you can give it faster sleep paramters for tests
- openapi?
- some sort of ecs? (legion?)
- vagrant -> lxc
