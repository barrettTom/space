space

ideas
- construction module (upgrade ship, create stations which perform module functions better and cheaper)
- weapons modules
- communication module (various ranges of tx/rx, encryption of messages)
- tiers of minerals, modules
- pretty dashboard
- better client cli parsing (e.g. ability to do ./client navigation)
- some sort of energy / fuel mechanic for all processes, solar panels if stranded
- server ability to quit and import/export all data
- collisions
- figure how position floats overflow and how to improve it
- figure out spawning
- figure out some sort of dynamic zone system
- figure out other bodies (planets, suns, n-body simulation?)
- bookmarking objects (e.g. stations, estimates position & velocity outside navigation)
- maybe create interface with masses data
